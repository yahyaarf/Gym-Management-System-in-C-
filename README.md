# ðŸ’ª Gym Management System in C++

An object-oriented Gym Management System implemented in C++. This console-based application models core components of a gym business and demonstrates foundational OOP concepts in practice.

## Overview

This system simulates and manages three key entities:

- **Clients** â€“ Gym members with personal details and membership plans
- **Trainers** â€“ Staff with unique schedules and qualifications
- **Products** â€“ Items or supplements available for sale at the gym

Designed for learning and practice, it emphasizes clarity in class design and efficient object interactions.

## Key OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- **Class Design & Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance** (`Trainer` inherits from `Client`)
- **Composition** (e.g., `Client` owns a list of `Product`s)
- **Static Members** for tracking global data
- **Friend Functions** for privileged access
- **Randomized Schedule Generation** for trainers

## Features

 Add and manage client profiles  
 Register trainers and auto-generate daily schedules  
 Manage and display a global product list (e.g., supplements, equipment)  
 Simulated trainer-client interactions  
 Simple console menu-driven UI
